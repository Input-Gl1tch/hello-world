Just another repository

Hello my fellow guinea pigs,
You may be wondering, why I have refered to you as "guinea pigs"
To put it simply, nobody here is in control of our own lives, we're constintly being monitored
We may think we have power, but that's just it, we THINK we have power, 
They have planted that seed 
The seed that grows the idea that WE, the guinea pigs, are in full control
